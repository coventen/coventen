    "subTitle": "Why Eddy Current Testing (ET) ",
    "desc": "Eddy Current Testing (ET) is a widely used non-destructive testing (NDT) method that is based on the principle of electromagnetic induction. It is primarily employed to inspect conductive materials for surface and near-surface defects, as well as to assess material properties such as conductivity and thickness. Eddy Current Testing is non-contact and capable of rapid inspections, making it well-suited for various industries, including aerospace, automotive, manufacturing, and power generation.",
    "points": [
      "Principles of Eddy Current Testing (ET)\n        The fundamental principle of Eddy Current Testing involves the generation of alternating current in a probe coil when it is brought close to a conductive material. This alternating current creates changing magnetic fields that induce eddy currents in the conductive material. The presence of defects, variations in material thickness, or changes in electrical conductivity causes disruptions in the eddy currents. These disruptions are detected by the probe coil, and the resulting signals are analysed to identify defects or evaluate material properties.\n        ",
      "Eddy Current Testing can be performed using various types of probes, such as surface probes, encircling probes, and bobbin probes, each tailored for specific applications. The method is sensitive to defects near the surface and can detect surface-breaking cracks, corrosion, and material degradation. It is particularly useful for inspecting non-magnetic materials, including metals, metal alloys, and some non-metallic materials with conductive properties",
      "One of the key advantages of Eddy Current Testing is its ability to perform inspections through thin coatings or paint, making it suitable for quality control of coated components. Additionally, Eddy Current Testing can be utilized for sorting materials based on their electrical conductivity and determining material hardness and heat treatment conditions",
      "As with any NDT method, proper training and experience are essential for Eddy Current Testing inspectors to accurately interpret the signals and identify relevant indications. The inspection results are typically displayed in real-time on an instrument screen, allowing immediate evaluation and on-site decision-making",
      "In summary, Eddy Current Testing is a versatile and valuable NDT technique for inspecting conductive materials for surface defects, assessing material properties, and ensuring the integrity and quality of critical components in various industries. Its rapid inspection capabilities and non-contact nature make it an essential tool for modern quality assurance and non-destructive evaluatio",

    "title": "Magnetic Particle Testing (MT)",
    "subTitle": "Why Magnetic Particle Testing (MT)",
    "desc": "We shortly call this method as MT and is used to detect surface and near-surface defects in ferromagnetic materials. Magnetic particles are applied to the surface, and the presence of defects is revealed by the attraction and accumulation of the particles. It relies on the principle that magnetic field distortion occurs around a defect, and this distortion can be visualized using magnetic particles. ",
    "points": [
      "The core fundamental principle of Magnetic Particle /MT Testing is based on the interaction between magnetic fields and material defects. When a magnetic field is applied to a ferromagnetic material, such as iron, steel, or nickel, the magnetic field lines pass through the material, creating an invisible magnetic flux. If there is a defect, such as a crack, porosity, or inclusion, present on or near the surface, the magnetic field lines become distorted, causing a leakage of the magnetic flux.",
      "During the inspection, a magnetic field is induced into the test object either through direct magnetization (using a magnetic yoke or electromagnetic coil) or through indirect magnetization (using a magnetic bench or prod). Next, magnetic particles are applied to the surface of the test object in the form of dry particles or as a wet suspension (magnetic ink). These particles are specifically designed to be attracted to areas of magnetic flux leakage, making defects visible",
      "If there is a surface or near-surface defect present, the magnetic particles will accumulate at the defect site, forming a visible indication. The indications take the form of well-defined lines or clusters, outlining the shape and extent of the defect. Inspectors can then examine these indications to assess the type, size, and location of the detected defects.",
      "One of the advantages of Magnetic Particle Testing is its ability to inspect large areas rapidly. It is a cost-effective method that allows for quick and reliable detection of defects, even in complex geometries and hard-to-reach locations. Additionally, the technique can be used on various shapes and sizes of ferromagnetic materials, making it highly versatile.",
      "Overall, Magnetic Particle Testing is an essential tool in the NDT toolkit, providing valuable information about the integrity and quality of ferromagnetic materials, contributing to the safety and reliability of critical components and structures in a wide range of industries.",
